bouncy-castle-csharp
====================

Source code for my "Creating certificates using Bouncy Castle" series of blog entries. See http://blog.differentpla.net/blog/2013/03/18/using-bouncy-castle-from-net

**Important:** The version of BouncyCastle used in the project is outdated and has at least one security vulnerability associated with it. Bear that in mind if you want to use this as an example.

While I think this project is still useful, I no longer have the time to keep it up to date, so I'm going to archive it.
